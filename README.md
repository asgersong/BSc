# Bridging the Gap: Integrating Linear Algebra in the Development and Understanding of Large Language Models for Software Engineering Applications

## Overview

This repository contains the code and related files for my bachelor thesis, "Bridging the Gap: Integrating Linear Algebra in the Development and Understanding of Large Language Models for Software Engineering Applications," submitted to the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aarhus University.

## Abstract

This bachelorâ€™s thesis delves into the integration of linear algebra concepts in the development and optimization of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software en- gineering applications. The thesis presents the theoretical underpinnings of LLMs, particularly focusing on the transformer architecture and its components. Further- more, it explores practical applications through the development of a Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot prototype, designed to assist students by providing contextually accurate and detailed responses. The chatbot leverages state-of-the-art models and integrates user-uploaded documents to enhance inter- action quality. Additionally, a case study on the low-rank approximation of the BART model assesses the effectiveness of reducing computational complexity and storage requirements while maintaining performance on summarization tasks. The results, evaluated through ROUGE scores, underscore that low-rank approximation can significantly optimize model efficiency, but also highlight the trade-offs between performance and resource optimization. This work contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical linear algebra concepts and their practical applications in mod- ern natural language processing tasks (NLP), offering insights for future research and development in the field.
