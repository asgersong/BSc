\chapter{Introduction}
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), driving significant advancements and innovations. These models are designed to understand, generate, and interpret human language at a level that is increasingly indistinguishable from that of a human being. The development and evolution of LLMs mark a pivotal shift in how machines can learn from and interact with textual data, enabling a plethora of applications ranging from automated text generation to sophisticated conversational agents.
